The most challenging part about this assignment was getting familiar with qt in python but that was not really hard to over come considering that I have been wanting to find out how to graph stocks so I was really excited throught this whole assignment. The hardest part was trying to find some time in my schedule to actually work on this assignment between essays and other classes I had to work on but whenever I did get time to work on this project I just got lost trying to solve every problem I had. I decided to create a stock graph just like the one in robinhood, yahoo finance and many other stock graph websites or apps out there. I would tell future students to just find something that you have always wanted to learn how to code or create and do not be scared to go for it, it will be a challenge but the feeling you get when you run your program and it works!... I however did not get the chance to implement some things that I wanted like a candle stick graph so that I can get all the data like open, high, low close, and the flow on certain days, months and years. I also did not get to mess around with the color and background of the graph but am fairly happy on how it turned out.
