# StockViewGUI
<h2> Overview </h2>
For this project I will be working with the PyQt5, pandas_datareader, and matplotlib libraries to build a stock searching GUI. When the user runs the app they will be greated with a graph that has the x and y-axis labeled, a text area so the user can look up a company stocks price, buttons next to the text area where if the user clicks the graph will adjust to how far back they want to go with the companies data(from one day - 5 years from present time), and 3 checkboxes which include the 20 day moving average, 50 day moving average, and 200 day moving average of the companies stock price and if clicked the moving average line will be drawn on the graph and when unchecked the line will be removed.
